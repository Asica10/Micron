# Crazy Ivan with double shear
In Crazy Ivan mod one stepper is mounted upside down. The main advantage of this solution is that you can use a standard stepper with a 22 mm shaft, which is supported by a bearing over the entire thickness of the bearing.
Mod required 2pcs of F695 flanged bearing.

Note: for this mod you need to print 2x B stepper mod from main repo ( A stepper mod is not used).
